Translation:

Indeed, in the creation of the heavens and the earth and the alternation of the day and
night there are signs for people of reason. ˹They are˺ those who remember Allah
while standing, sitting, and lying on their sides, and reflect on the creation
of the heavens and the earth ˹and pray˺, “Our Lord! You have not created ˹all
of˺ this without purpose. Glory be to You! Protect us from the torment of the
Fire. Our Lord! Indeed, those You commit to the Fire will be ˹completely˺
disgraced! And the wrongdoers will have no helpers. Our Lord! We have heard the
caller to ˹true˺ belief, ˹proclaiming,˺ ‘Believe in your Lord ˹alone˺,’ so we
believed. Our Lord! Forgive our sins, absolve us of our misdeeds, and allow us
˹each˺ to die as one of the virtuous. Our Lord! Grant us what You have promised
us through Your messengers and do not put us to shame on Judgment Day—for
certainly You never fail in Your promise.” So their Lord responded to them:
“I will never deny any of you—male or female—the reward of your deeds. Both are
equal in reward. Those who migrated or were expelled from their homes, and were
persecuted for My sake and fought and ˹some˺ were martyred—I will certainly
forgive their sins and admit them into Gardens under which rivers flow, as a
reward from Allah. And with Allah is the finest reward!” Do not be deceived by
the prosperity of the disbelievers throughout the land. It is only a brief
enjoyment. Then Hell will be their home—what an evil place to rest! But those
who are mindful of their Lord will be in Gardens under which rivers flow, to
stay there forever—as an accommodation from Allah. And what is with Allah is
best for the virtuous. Indeed, there are some among the People of the Book who
truly believe in Allah and what has been revealed to you ˹believers˺ and what
was revealed to them. They humble themselves before Allah—never trading Allah’s
revelations for a fleeting gain. Their reward is with their Lord. Surely Allah
is swift in reckoning. O believers! Patiently endure, persevere, stand on
guard, and be mindful of Allah, so you may be successful.

O Allah, by Your Knowledge of the unseen
and by Your Power over creation, let me live if You know that life is good for
me, and let me die if You know that death is good for me. O Allah, I ask You to
grant me fear of You in private and in public. I ask you for the word of truth
in times of contentment and anger. I ask You for moderation in wealth and in
poverty. I ask you for blessings never ceasing and the coolness of my eye (i.e.
pleasure) that never ends. I ask You for pleasure after Your Judgment and I ask
You for a life of coolness after death. I ask You for the delight of gazing
upon Your Face, and the joy of meeting You, without any harm and misleading
trials befalling me. O Allah, dress us with the beauty of Faith and make us
guides who are upon (correct) guidance.

Chapter 26: For seeking guidance in forming a decision or choosing the proper

course

Hisn al-Muslim 74

Transliteration:

Jabir bin Abdullah (RA) said:
The Prophet (ﷺ) used to teach us to seek Allah's Counsel in all matters, as he
used to teach us a Surah from the Qur'an. He would say: When anyone of you has
an important matter to decide, let him pray two Rak'ahs other than the
obligatory prayer, and then say: Allāhumma innī astakhīruka bi `ilmik, wa
astaqdiruka biqudratik, wa as'aluka min faḍlika ‘l-`Aẓīm, fa'innaka taqdiru wa
lā aqdir, wa ta`lamu wa lā a`lam, wa anta `allāmu ‘l-ghuyūb, Allāhumma in kunta
ta`lamu anna hādha ‘l-amra - [then mention the thing to be decided] Khayrun lī
fī dīnī wa ma`āshī wa `āqibati amrī - [or say] `ājilihi wa ājilih - faqdurhu lī
wa yassirhu lī thumma bārik lī fīh, wa in kunta ta`lamu anna hādha ‘l-amra
sharrun lī fī dīnī wa ma`āshī wa `āqibati 'amrī - [or say] `ājilihi wa 'ājilihi
- faṣrifhu `annī waṣrifnī `anh, waqdur liya ‘l-khayra ḥaythu kān, thumma arḍinī
bih.

Translation

"O Allah, I seek the counsel of Your Knowledge, and I seek the help of
Your Omnipotence, and I beseech You for Your Magnificent Grace. Surely, You are
Capable and I am not. You know and I know not, and You are the Knower of the
unseen. O Allah, if You know that this matter [then mention the thing to be
decided] is good for me in my religion and in my life and for my welfare in the
life to come, - [or say: in this life and the afterlife] - then ordain it for
me and make it easy for me, then bless me in it. And if You know that this
matter is bad for me in my religion and in my life and for my welfare in the
life to come, - [or say: in this life and the afterlife] - then distance it
from me, and distance me from it, and ordain for me what is good wherever it
may be, and help me to be content with it." Whoever seeks the counsel of the
Creator will not regret it and whoever seeks the advice of the believers will
feel confident about his decisions, for Allah has said in the Qur'an: "And
consult them in the affair. Then when you have taken a decision, put your trust
in Allah."

the afternoon ('Asr) prayer, until the sun sets, is more beloved to me than
freeing four slaves from among the Children of Isma'il." This was reported by
